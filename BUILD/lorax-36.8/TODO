### Definitely do these:
- Write man pages for the included executables
- Write a templaterunner script

### These might be good ideas:
- Move conf hash table to something more object-like
- Merge treeinfo and discinfo stuff in to InstRoot class
- Port OptionParser code to ArgumentParser

### These are some longer-term things:
- Keep all build config files in one directory
- Move everything in Lorax.{configure,run}() to config files/templates
- Better debug output (esp. for tracebacks)
